        This is my personal macOS setup using Ansible and will be updating it as I go along. 
                          (Currently compatible for macOS Sonoma 14.0)

#

# Option 1: Ansible macOS setup automatic

Tested on Monterey. Requires python3. Only supports intel macs for now.

### Prerequisites

Install XCode. (The command line tools are insufficient. python3 seems to be unable to verify ssl certificates without the full app).

## How do?

### For the impatient

1. Run `init.sh`. You'll be prompted for your password.
1. Grant yourself passwordless sudo permission: `sudoers.sh -K -e nopasswd=yes`. You'll be prompted for your password.
1. Run the bootstrap script: `bootstrap.sh`.
1. Run the playbook: `setup.sh`.

### For the more patient

1. Run `init.sh`, which does the following:
    1. Accepts the Xcode license (may prompt for admin password)
    1. Installs ansible (`pip3 install --user ansible`)
    1. Installs task dependencies in `requirements.txt` (again, with `pip3 install --user`).
    1. Installs dependencies in `requirements.yml` using `ansible-galaxy`.
1. Optionally grant users the ability to use sudo with `sudoers.sh -K`. See `sudoers-playbook.yml` for
   options.
1. Run `bootstrap.sh -K` (omit `-K` if you're set up with passwordless `sudo`). This runs `bootstrap-playbook.yml`,
   which runs the Xcode first launch tasks (if necessary) and installs [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/), along with
   several ports needed to make setup tasks work properly. You only need to do this once. The playbook is imported in
   `setup-playbook.yml`, so the tasks will run again if necessary.
1. Sign in to the app store app.
   `mas` cannot install apps unless you do so, and sign in via the command line no longer works.
   See [mas known issues](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas#%EF%B8%8F-known-issues).
1. Run `setup.sh -K` (omit `-K` if you're set up with passwordless `sudo`). The script passes all 
arguments on to `ansible-playbook`.
1. The following `tags` are defined (which you can pass to the script, e.g., `setup.sh --tags ports`):
    - **apps**:      Install applications from the app store using `mas` and from non-app-store disk images
      (see `vars/mas.yml` and `vars/dmgs.yml`).
      You must be signed in to the app store for `mas` to function properly.

    - **customize**: Customize app and OS settings.
      You need to log out and log back in to apply many of the changes.

    - **dotfiles**:  Clone my [dotfiles](https://github.com/conleym/dotfiles) and
     [emacs config](https://github.com/conleym/dot-emacs).

    - **emacs**:     Clone emacs from github, build, and install.
      Clones my [emacs config](https://github.com/conleym/dot-emacs).

    - **fonts**:     Install fonts (see `vars/fonts.yml`).

    - **launchd**:   Load launchd jobs (see `vars/launchd.yml`).

    - **pip**:       Install pip packages (see `vars/pip.yml`).

    - **ports**:     Install/update a configurable list of ports/variants
      (see `vars/ports.yml`).

    - **tex**:       Install [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).

### Other software installed

1. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
1. [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html)
1. [R](https://r-project.org/)
1. [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
1. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)

...and more.

### Fonts installed

1. [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
1. [DejaVu](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/)


### TODO

In general, more app preferences...

### Jetbrains toolbox

1. Accept the agreement.
1. Install selected IDEs. The toolbox seems to be missing functionality to do this from the command line. Investigate
AppleScript, Automator, etc.

### VLC

Automatically enable metadata retrieval, so I don't have to click on the popup, or even see the popup.

See https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=126302 and
https://community.jamf.com/t5/jamf-pro/suppressing-quot-enable-metadata-retrieval-quot-prompt-in-vlc/m-p/130327

### GPG tools

GPG tools on requires some manual setup. Open Mail > Preferences > General, click on "Manage Plug-ins...",
and check the box next to the GPGMailLoader plugin.

   2. sudo pip3 install ansible --upgrade pip
   3. pip3 install ansible
3. Clone this repo
4. Run `ansible-playbook main.yml -r requirements.yml` inside this directory. Enter your account password when prompted (for sudo access).
5. Run `ansible-playbook main.yml --ask-become-pass` inside this directory. Enter your macOS account password when prompted for the 'BECOME' password.
